# Laboratory of Advanced Modeling of Robots
In this project it has been developed the model for a *Bi-Glide* robot, which is compused by two parallel and actuated prismatic joints, next to the base of the structure, and three passive revolute joints, one of which constitutes the *end effector* of the parallel robot.  
The goal of this assignment was to compute the geometric, kinematic, of first and second order, and dynamic models of this robot, and to exploit them in order to compute the torques necessary to move it to reach the desired kinematics for each joint.  
After computing the models, they have been implemented in python and tested in ROS - Gazebo.
